As of May 16, 2019 I'm learning the basics of web development
<br>I'm depressed right now and feel like my life and career (Graphic Designer)
<br>is going nowhere.
<br>I've come to the conclusion that that is my own fault
<br>With coding, I aim to make software that would make people's lives easier or at least make them laugh.
<br>I hope by the time 2020 rolls in I am in a better headspace. 
<br>Love,
<br>Nat

As of September 14,2019 I've gone through 60% of the <br>web dev 101 course. I've been lacking a plan this <br>whole time so my progress has been sporadic, and stagnant.
<br> I'm starting fresh again, relearn the basics, and refocusing on what I need to do
<br>
<br> Things will be better
<br>Love,
<br>Nat
